			<p style="text-align: center;">PASTI Ayer Lanas</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Jeli is where PASTI Ayer Lanas is situated. During my time as a student, the kindergarten was five minutes' drive from my residence. Now that I had moved to Kuala Krai, the kindergarten was distance from my residence.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">SK Bandar Kuala Krai</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">From 2011 to 2015, I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Kuala Krai to continue my education. This is actually my second elementary school; Sekolah Kebangsaan Ayer Lanas, Jeli is my first primary school, and it is located in Jeli. Thus, I continued from 2010 to 2011. Therefore, there were two learning sessions available in the morning and afternoon at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Kuala Krai. When I was in grades 1, 2, and 3, there were only morning learning sessions. When I was in grades 4, 5, and 6, there were morning learning sessions in addition to evening classes that were required. Additionally, as grade 6 is a busy year, extra classes are held on Saturdays, nights, and side evenings.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">Maahad Rahmaniah Kuala Krai</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">I then continued my study at the secondary level at Maahad Rahmaniah Kuala Krai from 2016 until 2020, when I was 13 years old. The regular school day resumes in the morning. There will be PT3 at level 3 and SPM at level 5 throughout the test year. With extra classes in the afternoon, evening, and on Friday and Saturday, these were two extremely hectic years.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">UITM Kota Bharu, Kelantan</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">Universiti Teknologi Mara made me an opportunity to enroll in their Business and Economics degree program. Being here is enjoyable for me because the atmosphere is so different from secondary school. I was initially somewhat disappointed because it was so close to my place. Since I find Kelantan to be uninteresting enough, I really want to study distant from home in order to gain fresh experiences.</p>
